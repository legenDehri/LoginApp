Login Application Control Flow
Based on the folder structure, this is a Spring Boot application that implements JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. Let me explain the control flow from when a user interacts with the login page to authentication completion:
Authentication Flow

User Interaction:

User navigates to index.html served from the static resources folder
The page loads with styles from styles.css and JavaScript from login.js
User enters credentials in the login form


Authentication Request:

The frontend JavaScript (login.js) captures the form submission
It sends a POST request with the credentials to the backend API
The request contains a LoginRequest DTO with username/email and password


Server-Side Processing:
a. Request Handling:

Incoming requests first pass through JwtAuthenticationFilter
For login requests (which don't have a token yet), the filter allows passage to controllers

b. Authentication Controller:

AuthController receives the login request
It processes the LoginRequest DTO and attempts authentication

c. Authentication Service:

UserService with help from UserDetailsServiceImpl verifies credentials
UserDetailsServiceImpl loads user details from UserRepository
Spring Security authentication manager validates the password

d. Token Generation:

On successful authentication, JwtUtils creates a JWT token
Token contains user identity and authorities/roles
JwtConfig provides configuration for token expiration and secret key

e. Response:

AuthController returns a JwtResponse DTO containing:

The generated JWT token
User details like username, roles, etc.




Post-Authentication:

Frontend stores the token (typically in localStorage)
Subsequent requests include this token in Authorization header
JwtAuthenticationFilter validates tokens in future requests



Registration Flow

User submits registration form with details captured in RegisterRequest DTO
AuthController processes the registration request
UserService validates input data and checks for existing users
If validation passes, the service creates a new User entity
UserRepository saves the new user to the database
Controller returns success response or redirects user to login

Security Configuration

WebSecurityConfig defines:

Which endpoints require authentication
Password encoding strategy
CORS and CSRF policies
Authentication entry points


JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint handles unauthorized access attempts with appropriate error responses

Overall Application Structure

MVC Pattern:

Models (User.java) define data structures
Views (HTML/CSS/JS) provide the user interface
Controllers (AuthController.java) handle request routing


Service Layer (UserService.java) contains core business logic
Repository Layer (UserRepository.java) handles database interactions
Security Layer handles authentication, authorization, and request filtering

This application implements a stateless authentication system using JWT tokens, which is ideal for modern web applications and APIs, especially those that might serve single-page applications or mobile clients.RetryClaude can make mistakes.
